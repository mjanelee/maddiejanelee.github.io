Hello! Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Maddie Lee and I'm a fifth-year PhD student at Stanford University. I was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota and graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 2019 with an A.B. in Biology. As an undergraduate, I worked in the lab of <a href="https://www.fehnigerlab.org/">Dr. Todd Fehiniger</a> at the Washington University School of Medicine, where I developed an interest in NK cells. I followed this passion to <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/blishlab.html">Dr. Catherine Blish's lab</a> at Stanford, where the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 drove me to study the NK cell response in the context of this disease. Through my dissertation research in the Blish Lab, I am striving to generate a holistic picture of the NK cell response in COVID-19. To learn more about each of the individual projects that comprise my thesis work, check out the graphic below!

When I'm not in lab, you can find me hiking, reading, or hanging out with my cat, Minneapolis. I'm also an (amateur) artist--you can see examples of my work under the <a href="https://mjanelee.github.io/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> tab.
