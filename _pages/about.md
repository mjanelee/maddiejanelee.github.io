Hello! Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Maddie Lee and I'm a fifth-year PhD student studying Immunology at Stanford University. I was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota and graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 2019 with an A.B. in Biology. As an undergraduate, I worked in the lab of <a href="https://www.fehnigerlab.org/">Dr. Todd Fehiniger</a> at the Washington University School of Medicine, where I developed an interest in NK cells. I followed this passion to <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/blishlab.html">Dr. Catherine Blish's lab</a> at Stanford, where the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 drove me to study the NK cell response in the context of this disease. Through my dissertation research in the Blish Lab, I am striving to generate a holistic picture of the NK cell response in COVID-19. My work seeks to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on host immune cells by profiling the unique phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional profiles of primary NK cells from COVID-19 patients and exploring how crosstalk between NK cells and other peripheral immune cells underpins the changes observed in COVID-19. I have also examined mechanisms of NK cell escape by mediated by SARS-CoV-2 in infected lung cells and studied how these responses are conserved or modified in variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses. To learn more about each of the individual projects that comprise my thesis work, check out the graphic below!

I'm currently on the job market! I am planning to graduate in the spring of 2024 and am seeking a postdoc position where I can continue to study human NK cells in the context of cancer or chronic viral infection. I'm particularly interested in the development and implementation of better model systems for the study of human NK cell responses in vitro. If you are looking for a highly motivated postdocoral scholar with a passion for NK cells and human immunology, please feel free to contact me--my Stanford email is mjanelee@stanford.edu.

When I'm not in lab, you can find me hiking, reading, <a href="https://mjanelee.github.io/portfolio/">painting</a>, or hanging out with my cat, <a href="/files/minne!.jpg">Minneapolis</a>. I'm also passionate about mental health in graduate school and regularly lead workshops on combating imposter syndrome in the Stanford Biosciences community.
